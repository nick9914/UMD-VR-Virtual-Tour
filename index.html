        <h1>UMD Virtual Tour</h1>
        <h2>Check Point: April 6 2016</h2>
        <h3>What We Have Accomplished</h3>
        <p>
            Proof of Concept: For the proof of concept, we were able to import the 360 Rioch Theta camera images into
            Unity by creating a sphere gameobject, inverting the normals on the sphere, wrapping the texture on the
            sphere, and finally centering the main camera at the center of the sphere.
        </p>
         <p>
             As a result, we were able to create a 360 immersive experience. The picture below demonstrates our findings:
         </p>
        <ul>
            <img src="images/IMG_4624.JPG" alt="VR Rioch Theta Image">
            <img src="images/IMG_4626.JPG" alt="VR Unity Image">
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since videos is comprised of a bunch still images changed at a certain fps, to mimic a video the texture of
            the sphere has to be updated at a certain fps. To accomplish this goal, the team will use E-Z Movie Texture
            tool found in the Unity Asset Store.
        </p>
